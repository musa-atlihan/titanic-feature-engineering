# Titanic Feature Engineering

Feature engineering applied for (from Kaggle) Titanic dataset.

Steps are Inspired by the great [work](http://trevorstephens.com/kaggle-titanic-tutorial/getting-started-with-r/) of Trevor Stephens and very similar, he uses R, i used pandas instead.

In addition i included logistic regression and FNN solutions with theano. Score was approximately 0.80 on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).
